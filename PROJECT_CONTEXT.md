# Project Context & Architecture

## Project Goals

**Primary Goal**: Create an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for taking screenshots of web pages using Playwright, allowing AI agents to automatically verify UI tasks by analyzing screenshots.

**Key Use Cases**:
- AI agent verification of localhost development servers
- Automated UI testing and validation
- Screenshot capture for web development workflows
- Integration with AI development tools for enhanced capabilities

**Why This Matters**: AI agents need to be able to "see" the results of UI changes they make. Screenshots provide visual feedback for AI-driven development tasks.

## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
- **Node.js 20+ with TypeScript**: Modern JavaScript runtime with strong typing
- **Playwright**: Browser automation for reliable screenshot capture
- **Sharp**: High-performance image processing for format conversion
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for consistency across environments
- **MCP Protocol**: Standard protocol for AI tool integration

### Key Technical Decisions Made

**1. Docker-First Approach**
- **Why**: Ensures consistent browser environment across different systems
- **Benefits**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues with Playwright browsers
- **Implementation**: Multi-stage Dockerfile with full Playwright dependencies

**2. Biome over ESLint + Prettier**
- **Why**: User preference for faster tooling
- **Configuration**: Comprehensive linting and formatting rules in `biome.json`

**3. Multiple Image Format Support (PNG, JPEG, WebP)**
- **Why**: Flexibility for different use cases and performance requirements
- **PNG**: Lossless quality for UI screenshots with text and sharp edges
- **JPEG**: Efficient compression for photographic content and gradients
- **WebP**: Best compression with good quality for modern browsers
- **Implementation**: Sharp-based image processing with quality-first capture strategy

**4. Node.js Built-in Test Runner**
- **Why**: No external test dependencies, modern Node.js feature
- **Benefits**: Faster setup, fewer dependencies to manage

**5. Host Networking in Docker**
- **Why**: Direct access to localhost development servers
- **Fallback**: Port mapping configuration for environments where host networking doesn't work

**6. Non-root Container Security**
- **Implementation**: Dedicated 'playwright' user in container
- **Benefits**: Security best practices, proper file permissions

**7. Quality-First Image Processing**
- **Strategy**: Always capture as PNG (highest quality), then convert to requested format
- **Benefits**: Maintains maximum image quality while supporting all formats
- **Implementation**: Sharp library for reliable cross-platform image conversion
