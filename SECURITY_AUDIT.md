### Update Recommendations
- Consider updating dependencies with available patches
- All updates are minor/patch versions with no security implications
- Current versions are secure and stable

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Scans Performed
1. **npm audit** - Vulnerability scanning ‚úÖ
2. **Static code analysis** - Pattern matching for security issues ‚úÖ
3. **File system permissions** - Package content verification ‚úÖ
4. **Secret detection** - Hardcoded credential scanning ‚úÖ
5. **Input validation review** - Schema and validation analysis ‚úÖ

### Manual Security Review
1. **Cookie handling implementation** ‚úÖ
2. **File operation security** ‚úÖ
3. **Environment variable usage** ‚úÖ
4. **Browser automation security** ‚úÖ
5. **Network request patterns** ‚úÖ

## üöÄ Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of input validation
- Secure defaults throughout configuration
- Graceful error handling without information leakage

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege
- Minimal file system access (read-only configuration)
- Controlled network access (user-specified URLs only)
- Browser context isolation

### 3. Secure Development Lifecycle
- Pre-commit hooks with linting and formatting
- Comprehensive test coverage including security scenarios
- Automated dependency vulnerability monitoring

### 4. Data Minimization
- No persistent storage of sensitive data
- Automatic cleanup of temporary resources
- Cookie values excluded from all logging

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations for Users

### Cookie File Security
- **Store cookie files with restricted permissions** (600 or 700)
- **Use absolute paths** to prevent path confusion
- **Regularly rotate authentication tokens** in cookie files
- **Monitor cookie file access** in production environments

### Environment Variables
- **Avoid logging environment variables** containing sensitive data
- **Use file-based configuration** for sensitive settings when possible
- **Restrict access to MCP configuration files** containing credentials

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS URLs** when possible for screenshot targets
- **Validate target URLs** in production automation scenarios
- **Consider network isolation** for production screenshot services
- **Monitor network traffic** when processing untrusted URLs

## üîß Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Optional)
1. **Update Dependencies**: Consider updating to latest patch versions
   ```bash
   npm update
   ```

### Ongoing Security Practices
1. **Regular Dependency Audits**
   ```bash
   npm audit
   npm outdated
   ```

2. **Cookie File Security**
   ```bash
   chmod 600 /path/to/cookies.json  # Restrict file permissions
   ```

3. **Log Monitoring**
   ```bash
   tail -f /tmp/browserloop.log  # Monitor for unusual activity
   ```

## ‚úÖ Security Compliance

### License Compliance
- **AGPL-3.0-or-later**: Compliant with open source requirements
- **Network Services**: Users must provide source code if modified for network services
- **Patent Protection**: Contributors provide patent grants

### Data Protection
- **No Personal Data Storage**: BrowserLoop doesn't store personal information
- **Temporary Processing**: Screenshots processed in memory, not persisted
- **User Control**: Users control all data inputs and targets
